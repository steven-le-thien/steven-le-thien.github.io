abstract = {Consider an array of random variables (Xi,j), 1 ≤ i,j < ∞, such that permutations of rows or of columns do not alter the distribution of the array. We show that such an array may be represented as functions f(α, ξi, ηj, λi,j) of underlying i.i.d, random variables. This result may be useful in characterizing arrays with additional structure. For example, we characterize random matrices whose distribution is invariant under orthogonal rotation, confirming a conjecture of Dawid.}
